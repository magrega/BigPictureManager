A small app to allow switching audio playback devices when Steam Big Picture starts since Steam itself doesn't do this. Also you can turn off BT on app close to turn off your controller automatically when it is connected directly with bluetooth radio. 
Since there's no xbox controller api available it's impossible to turn it off when it is connected with Xbox wireless adapter.

TO-DO:
1. Make it a tray app
2. Switch audio to the previous device on BP close
3. Turn off Xbox controller through API? (not possible now because no api available)
4. Compile into a single .exe
5. Save settings in .ini file
6. Refactor the whole thing since C# is not my strong suit
