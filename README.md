A small app to allow switching audio playback devices when Steam Big Picture starts since Steam itself doesn't do this. Also you can turn off BT on app close to turn off your controller automatically when it is connected directly with bluetooth radio. 
Since there's no xbox controller api available it's impossible to turn it off when it is connected with Xbox wireless adapter.

TO-DO:
1. ~~Make it a tray app~~
2. ~~Launch on startup checkbox~~
3. ~~Switch audio to the selected device on BP start~~
4. ~~Turn off bluetooth checkbox on BP close~~
5. ~~Switch audio to the previous device on BP close~~
6. ~~Compile into a single .exe~~
7. ~~Check for a TV audio device to preset~~
8. Save app state
9. Change audio only when BP is on TV
10. Refactor the whole thing since C# is not my strong suit
11. Turn off Xbox controller through API? (not possible now, no api available)
